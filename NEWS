NEWS/ChangeLog for MSmix
--------------------------

1.0.1   2024-04-08

BUG FIXES
    o   fitMSmix(...)
        [::] stopping rule of the EM algorithm adjusted to avoid ERROR in CRAN checks for MacOS-arm64.

MAJOR CHANGES
    o   bootstrapMSmix(...):
        [::] replaced former arguments `n_clust`, `z_hat`, `rho_mle` and `theta_mle` with `object`
             to exploit the S3 class "emMSmix".
        [::] added new argument `parallel` for parallel execution of model fit in the case of
             partial rankings.
    o   confintMSmix(...):
        [::] replaced former arguments `n_items`, `theta_mle`, `weights_mle` and `z_hat` with `object`
             to exploit the S3 class "emMSmix".
        [::] indication of the function validity for full rankings only.
    o   spear_dist_distr(...):
        [::] new implementation to allow computation also for n_items>170 and return the approximate
             distribution over a fixed grid of Spearman distance values to limit computational burden.

NEW FUNCTIONS
    o   data_censoring(...) for converting full rankings into partial rankings.

NEW FEATURES
    o   Added package `gmp` in Imports.

DOCUMENTATION
    o   The manual has been globally reviewed and updated with the new implementation details.
